## Managing Environments

We accomplish managing different environments by symlinking all the folders that should be unique to each network environment (e.g. `host_vars/`, `group_vars/`, `inventories/`, `files/vpn/`, and `files/ssh/`). In the `environments/` folder, you will see multiple folders. In our case, `environments/dev/` contains sensible configurations for testing the playbook and its' roles. The production environment is a seperate git submodule that links to a private git repository that contains our Ansible-vaulted API keys and passwords. When you are ready to set up your production configurations, you can use this method as well. But if you are just starting off, you do not have to worry about this since, by default, this playbook is configured to run with the settings included in the `/environments/dev/` folder.

As a convienience feature, we created a bash script that will set up all the symlinks for you. You can run this by running `bash environments/dev/link.sh`. This command will symlink all the folders in selected environment to their appropriate locations in the base project. If you create a new environment, you will have to add a symlink to the `link.sh` file found in `files/link.sh` to retain this feature.
