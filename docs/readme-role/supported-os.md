## Supported Operating Systems

The chart below shows the operating systems that we have tested this role on. It is automatically generated using the Ansible Molecule tests located in the `molecule/default/` folder. There is logic in place to automatically handle the testing of Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, and Archlinux. If your operating system is not listed but is a variant of one of the systems we test (i.e. a Debian-flavored system or a RedHat-flavored system) then it is possible that the role will still work.

{{ compatibility }}

_The compatibility chart above was last generated on {{ compatibility_date }}._

**_What does idempotent mean?_** Idempotent means that if you run this role twice in row then there will be no changes to the system the second time around.
