      $ Switch environments using an interactive dialogue

      Ansible does not really provide any great ways to switch between environments (or sets of
      host_vars, group_vars etc.). If you place all the files and folders you wish to constitute
      as an environment inside a folder named as the name of the environment then you can use
      this task to handle the symlinking and switching between environments.

      You can directly switch enironments to `environments/prod/` by running:
      > task ansible:environment -- prod

      $ Find roles that are missing any given file

      This task scans through all the folders in the roles/ directory and checks
      for the presence of a file that you pass in through the CLI.

      Example usage:
      > task find-missing-files -- logo.png

      The example above will look through all the folders two levels deep (e.g. ./roles/tools/nmap,
      ./roles/system/snapd)in the roles folder and display any roles that are missing the file.

      In the playbook, roles are sometimes referred to by their folder name and in other cases
      they are referred to with their namespace prepended (e.g. \{{.GALAXY_NAMESPACE}}.role_name).
      This can cause issues so, in order for everything to work, each folder needs to be symlinked
      to ~/.ansible/roles with the namespace prepended.

      $ Automatically populate meta/main.yml and requirements.yml

      A role can sometimes have dependencies that need to be installed prior to being run (e.g. most
      roles in Ansible >2.9 need the `community.general` collection installed). Roles also sometimes
      need other roles to run before they are run (e.g. a task that installs a Node.js package needs
      the Node.js installer to run first). This task will scan for common dependencies by doing a text
      search for a handful of common strings. It will then attempt to automatically populate
      `meta/main.yml` and the `requirements.yml`.

      Items it attempts to auto-populate for:
        * chocolatey.chocolatey        * community.general.gem

      $ Symlink this role to ~/.ansible/roles/\{{.GALAXY_NAMESPACE}}.\{{.GALAXY_ROLE_NAME}}

      Roles are sometimes referred to by their folder name (which ideally is also the role_name in
      the meta/main.yml file) and they are sometimes referred to by their Ansible Galaxy name which
      has the namespace prepended (e.g. \{{.GALAXY_NAMESPACE}}.role_name). In order to make sure Ansible
      can find the role in both cases, a symlink in ~/.ansible/roles that points to the folder needs
      to be created.
