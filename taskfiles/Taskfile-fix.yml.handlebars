      $ Automatically format most files using Prettier

      This task will run Prettier on the project. Prettier will automatically fix formatting
      mistakes like inconsistent indent lengths, trailing spaces, and more. This task is a wrapper
      for the `npm run fix:prettier` command. It will use the configuration specified in the
      `package.json` file under the `prettier` key.

      If this command is incompatible with a file then you can add the file to the `.prettierignore`
      file.

      For more information on Prettier, see: https://prettier.io/
    cmds:
      - npm run fix:prettier

      $ Automatically fix and format Packer templates

      Packer has the ability to fix old templates that are using outdated methods. This task
      loops through all the files in the root of this repository that end with `template.json`.
      For each template, the task runs `packer fix`.

      For more information on `packer fix`, see: https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/fix

      $ Automatically format Python files using Black

      Black is the defacto standard when it comes to autoformatting Python files. This task will
      automatically format files that end with the `.py` extension. It currently excludes `.py` files
      that are in the folders with the following names:
        * .cache        * node_modules
        * .common       * roles
        * .git          * venv

    desc: (Experimental) Automatically apply fixes to .sh and .sh.j2 files using Shellcheck
    summary: |
      $ Automatically apply fixes to shell scripts using Shellcheck

      Shellcheck is generally used to lint shell scripts. It makes This task is a wrapper for the
      `npm run fix:shellcheck` command which uses Shellcheck and `git apply` to automatically
      apply Shellcheck's recommendations. The npm command is configured to apply the fixes to files
      that end with .sh or .sh.j2 files that are NOT in the following folders:
        * .cache        * .husky
        * .git          * node_modules
        * .husky        * slim_test

      This task is experimental. It may work to get rid of the Shellcheck lint errors but the code
      should still be tested since it might break things. Ideally, you should apply Shellcheck's
      recommendations manually.

      To see what changes Shellcheck will make to a file named `test.sh`, for example, you can run:
      > npx shellcheck -f diff test.sh

      To see the changes Shellcheck will make when you run this task, you can copy the line from
      the `package.json` file that corresponds to the `npm run fix:shellcheck` task, remove
      the ` | git apply` ending, and then run the command.

      For more information on Shellcheck, see: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck

      - npm run fix:shellcheck
