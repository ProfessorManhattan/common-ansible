      $ Lint an Ansible project using Ansible Lint

      This task lints the project using Ansible Lint which will scan the project and report design
      patterns that can possibly be improved. It can be used on both playbooks and roles. The
      configuration for Ansible Lint is stored in the root of the project in a file titled
      `.ansible-lint`. This configuration file is shared between all of our Ansible projects
      so any changes to it need to be made to the upstream Ansible common file repository. Because of
      this, it probably makes more sense to to disable rules (when absolutely necessary) using the
      syntax described in this link:
      https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules.html#false-positives-skipping-rules

      For more information on Ansible Lint, see: https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint

    summary: |
      $ Report formatting errors with Prettier

      This task will run Prettier on the project and list the possible fixes without automatically
      applying the fixes. It will report mistakes like inconsistent indent lengths, trailing spaces,
      and more. This task is a wrapper for the `npm run lint:prettier` command. It will use the configuration
      specified in the `package.json` file under the `prettier` key.

      If this command is incompatible with a file then you can add the file to the `.prettierignore`
      file.

      For more information on Prettier, see: https://prettier.io/

    desc: Lint Dockerfiles using Hadolint (requires Docker)
    summary: |
      $ Lint Dockerfiles using Hadolint

      Hadolint is a linter for Dockerfiles. This task uses Hadolint to report warnings
      and suggestions so that the project is using best practices and is less likely to
      have errors. The task uses Docker to run an ultra-compact container that includes
      Hadolint. Installing Hadolint is done at runtime. The task scans for all files that
      are named either `Dockerfile` or `Dockerfile.j2`. On top of reporting suggestions
      for adhereing to Docker best-practices, Hadolint also leverages Shellcheck to report
      possible errors in the shell logic used by the Dockerfile.

      If the Dockerfile is named something other than `Dockerfile` or `Dockerfile.j2`, you
      can manually run Hadolint by running:
      > docker run -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work megabytelabs/hadolint:slim CustomDockerfileName

      This task will ignore files in the following directories:
        * .cache        * .husky        * node_modules
        * .common       * .modules      * test
        * .git          * .task         * venv

    desc: Scan markdown files for broken links
    summary: |
      $ Report any broken links in the files that end with .md

      This task uses the npm package called `markdown-link-check` to scan all the links
      and then report which ones are broken.

      For more information on `markdown-link-check`, see the following page:

      $ Validate Packer templates

      This task will loop through all the Packer templates ending with `template.json`
      in the root of this project and report any errors that the templates might have.

      For more information on `packer validate`, see: https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/validate
    cmds:

    desc: Lint Python files using Flake8
    summary: |
      $ Lint Python files using Flake8

      Flake8 is a Python library that lints Python projects (or projects that may include Python files).
      It is a combination of several Python linters like PyFlakes and pycodestyle. This task will run
      `flake8` using the configuration found in the `.flake8` file in the root of this project.

      The `.flake8` file is a common file shared across many of our repositories so if changes are made to
      it then the changes need to be made to the appropriate common file repository here:
      https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/common. Because of this, it might make more sense to add a comment
      to lines that you wish to be ignored by flake8. For instance, you can ignore rule E234 by adding
      a comment at the end of the line that looks like, "# noqa: E234".

      NOTE: In order to maintain our strict quality standards, disabling Flake8 rules should only be done
      when absolutely necessary.

      For more information on Flake8, see: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8
    cmds:
      - flake8 .
    sources:
      - "**/*.py"

    summary: |
      $ Report possible errors in shell scripts using Shellcheck

      Shellcheck is a tool that reports warnings and suggestions for shell (e.g. bash) scripts. This
      task is a wrapper for the `npm run lint:shellcheck` command. The npm command scans the project
      for files ending with `.sh` or `.sh.j2` and runs Shellcheck on them. Files in the following folders
      are ignored:
        * .cache        * .husky
        * .git          * node_modules
        * .husky        * slim_test

      For more information on Shellcheck, see: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck
    cmds:

          -o -type f \( -name \*.sh -o -name \*.sh.j2 \) -print0 | xargs -0 -r -n1 shellcheck

{{#if hbs.vagrant}}
  vagrant:
    deps:
      - :software:vagrant
    desc: Validate the Vagrantfile
    summary: |
      $ Validate the Vagrantfile

      This task is an alias for `vagrant validate`. Vagrant's `validate` command
      will ensure the Vagrantfile in the root of this repository has no errors and
      is using valid syntax.

      For more information on `vagrant validate`, see: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/validate
    cmds:
      - vagrant validate

    desc: Lint .yml files using YAML Lint
    summary: |
      $ Lint YML files using YAML Lint

      YAML Lint is a general purpose linter tool that reports suggestions for `.yml`
      files. It checks for syntax validity as well as cosmetic problems like line
      lengths, trailing spaces, and indentation. The configuration file is in the root
      of the repository in the file named `.yamllint`. The `.yamllint` file is shared
      across all of our projects so if you need to make changes to get rid of warnings
      it will generally make more sense to disable YAML Lint for a single line using the
      method described here: https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint#features.

      NOTE: Disabling YAML Lint rules should only be done when absolutely necessary.

      For more information on YAML Lint, see: https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint
    cmds:
      - yamllint -s .
    sources:
      - "**/*.yml"
