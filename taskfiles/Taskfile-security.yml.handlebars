      $ Analyze the Docker container with Snyk

      One of the services Snyk provides is the capability to identify Docker container vulnerabilities. These
      vulnerabilities can potentially be used by bad actors. Normally, care should be taken to fix
      the vulnerabilities Snyk reports whenever possible. To use Snyk, you must be authenticated with their
      service. Signing up is free and easy (albeit, there is a limit to the number of scans you can run for free).
      All you have to do is run `snyk auth` with the `snyk` NPM package installed.

      $ Analyze the Docker container with Trivy

      Trivy is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability and misconfiguration scanner for containers
      and other artifacts. This task leverages Trivy's ability to report possible vulnerabilities in
      the Docker container.
