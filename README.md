# Megabyte Labs Common Files

All of the projects in the Megabyte Labs eco-system inherit many of their files (e.g. configuration files) from a cascade of [common file repositories](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/common). Each repository includes a bundle of shared files as a submodule. The submodule is located in the `.common/` folder in the root of each project. The submodule links to the common file repository that corresponds to the type of project (e.g. Ansible projects link their `.common/` folder to the [Ansible common files repository](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/common/ansible)).
