#   By including this library, you can install various programs without root access.
#   The software is installed to the ~/.local/bin folder and the PATH is set up
#   appropriately. This file exports the following functions:
#
#   * ensureDockerPushRMInstalled - Ensures the [docker-pushrm](https://github.com/christian-korneck/docker-pushrm) plugin is installed.
#   * ensureDockerSlimInstalled - Ensures [DockerSlim](https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim) is installed.
#   * ensureJQInstalled - Ensures [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) is installed.
#   * ensureNodeSetup - Ensures [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is setup and that [signale](https://github.com/klaussinani/signale) and [hbs-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hbs-cli) are installed as global dependencies
#   * ensurePackerInstalled - Ensures [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) is installed
#   * ensureTaskInstalled - Ensures [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/) is installed
#   * ensureVagrantInstalled - Ensures [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is installed
